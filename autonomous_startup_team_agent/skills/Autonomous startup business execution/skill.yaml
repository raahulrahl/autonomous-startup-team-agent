    This agent simulates a complete startup executive team with a CEO orchestrating five specialized agents.
    Each agent has distinct responsibilities and tools, enabling autonomous execution of complex business operations.
    The CEO agent delegates tasks to appropriate team members and synthesizes their insights for strategic decisions.
    Built on the Agno framework with OpenRouter models, featuring memory persistence via Mem0 and web research capabilities.
